 Emergency Vehicle Priority:
   Implement a system where emergency vehicles (like ambulances or fire trucks) can be given priority. This could involve:
   - Adding a new vehicle type for emergency vehicles.
   - Implementing a mechanism to change traffic signals when an emergency vehicle is detected.
   - Visualizing the emergency vehicle differently (e.g., with flashing lights).
 Pedestrian Crossings:
   Add pedestrian crossings at the intersection:
   - Implement pedestrian signals that coordinate with the vehicle signals.
   - Add a pedestrian generation and movement system.
   - Include pedestrian waiting areas and crossing animations.
 Time-of-Day Traffic Patterns:
   Implement varying traffic patterns based on the time of day:
   - Create a day/night cycle in the simulation.
   - Adjust vehicle generation rates and types based on simulated time (e.g., more buses during rush hours).
   - Visualize the time of day (change background, add a clock
 User Interaction:
   Allow user interaction with the simulation:
   - Add ability to manually control traffic lights.
   - Implement a system to add or remove vehicles on demand.
   - Allow adjusting simulation parameters (speed, vehicle generation rate) in real-time.
 Multi-Intersection Simulation:
   Expand the simulation to cover multiple intersections:
   - Implement a larger road network with multiple connected intersections.
   - Coordinate traffic signals across intersections for better flow.
